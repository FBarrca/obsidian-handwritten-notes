The plugin is based around **PDFs** as a annotation platform that is open and can be used on any device (works on Desktop and Mobile and outside Obsidian)

## Features
 - Create and edit handwritten notes with stylus
    - Embed notes into Obsidian Notes
    - Rich note taking with support for shapes, images, text, and more
    - Notes are stored as PDFs in your vault you can easily share them with others and use them on other devices

- PDF annotation

## Installation
To use this plugin you need to have **plugin** installed aswell as a **PDF viewer** that supports annotations. I recommend [Xodo](https://www.xodo.com/) for Desktop and [Xodo](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.xodo.pdf.reader&hl=en&gl=US) for Android. For iOS I havent tested any apps yet but I will update this section when I do. For the time, you can use Xodo or test the default PDF viewer on iOS.
