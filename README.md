Obsidian Handwritten Notes Plugin

Enhance your Obsidian experience with the Handwritten Notes plugin, designed to incorporate stylus notes seamlessly into your workflow. This plugin allows you to store and edit handwritten notes files in your vault.
In the future it will allow you to embed drawings in your documents, and create links to and from other documents or drawings within your notes.

Designed to imitate the functionality of the Excalidraw plugin for Obsidian, this plugin is, however, significantly more lightweight and open.

Take a quick look at a selection of our features showcased in the videos below.
